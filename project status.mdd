# Project Status

## Objective
Improve the Qt app so it follows screen-reader and keyboard accessibility best practices for a PR-ready set of changes.

## Progress Log
- [x] Pass 1 completed: shared controls now expose accessibility metadata and keyboard activation.
- [x] Pass 2 completed: explicit accessibility labels and keyboard behavior added in main/search/download/settings panels.
- [x] Pass 3 completed: delegates, dialogs, and hover-only download actions now include keyboard/screen-reader support.

## Build Status
- Attempted local build via README Windows flow.
- `scripts/windows/configure.bat` failed because `VCPKG_ROOT` defaulted to `C:\vcpkg` and that path is missing in this environment.
- Direct `cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=` then failed because Qt 6 CMake config is not installed (`Qt6Config.cmake` not found).
- Second build attempt after Pass 2:
- `scripts/windows/configure.bat` failed for missing `C:\vcpkg`.
- `scripts/windows/build.bat` failed because `..\..\build\ALL_BUILD.vcxproj` is unavailable without successful configure.
- Third build attempt after Pass 3:
- `scripts/windows/configure.bat` failed for missing `C:\vcpkg`.
- `scripts/windows/build.bat` failed because `..\..\build\ALL_BUILD.vcxproj` is unavailable without successful configure.
